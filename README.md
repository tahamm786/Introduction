# 👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Taha — a passionate and curious learner with a strong interest in Machine Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning, and building intelligent systems that can learn and adapt. I love turning ideas into working projects, and I believe hands-on building is the best way to learn.

🐍 I work primarily with Python, have hands-on experience with SQL, and a solid understanding of core ML concepts

🔭 Currently exploring autonomous agents, policy optimization, and visual input processing

🛠️ Always building and iterating on real-world inspired ML & RL projects

📚 Continuously learning and staying up to date with new techniques

🎯 Driven by curiosity and a love for solving meaningful problems with code

🤹‍♂️ Learning to balance exploration and exploitation — in RL and in life 😄

Whether it's training a neural network to play a game or building a robot to follow a lane, I enjoy the process of making machines smarter.
